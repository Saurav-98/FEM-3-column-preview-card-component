### What I learned

I just completed the 3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor, and I'm really happy about the result! I focused on using Semantic HTML5 to structure the content properly and enhance accessibility. CSS custom properties (variables) were a game-changer; they allowed me to manage styles efficiently, and I can easily make global changes. I also adopted a mobile-first approach, prioritizing the mobile design to ensure a great user experience on smaller screens. Media queries were key to making my design responsive. I used them to fine-tune the layout and styles for different screen sizes, making sure everything looked perfect. Flexbox was my go-to for layout, making everything flexible and responsive.

Through this challenge, I learned a lot about responsive design, the power of CSS variables, the importance of media queries, and had the chance to hone my problem-solving skills. It's been a fantastic learning experience, and I'm excited to take on more challenges to keep improving my development skills!

I'm thrilled to highlight that I achieved a fantastic responsive design in just 4 lines of code, all neatly placed within a single media query.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@media (min-width: 700px) {
  body {
    padding-block: 10.6875rem;
  }
  .cards__container {
    flex-direction: row;
    max-width: 57.5rem;
  }
}
```
